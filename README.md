## To-Do
- Subclass `PSRootListController` to include localization
- Switch to `CCUIContentModuleContainerViewController` for easier(?) disabling

## Localizations
Speak another language and want to add translations for it to the settings? Grab the template from [here](https://github.com/biD3V/Grounded/blob/main/groundedprefs/Resources/en.lproj/Localizable.strings), fill it out, and send it back to me along with what language it is!
